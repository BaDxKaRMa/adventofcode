# üéÑ advent-cli

This repo uses the Advent-CLI python tool (found in pypi). advent-cli is a command-line tool for interacting with Advent of Code, specifically geared toward writing solutions in Python. It can be used to view puzzle prompts, download input, submit solutions, and view personal or private stats and leaderboards.

## Installation

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/advent-cli/):

```
pip install advent-cli
```

Or grab the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/fergusch/advent-cli):

```
pip install git+https://github.com/fergusch/advent-cli.git@develop
```

## Setup

Before you do anything, you'll need to provide advent-cli with a session cookie so it can authenticate as you. To do this, log in to the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/) and grab the cookie named `session` from your browser's inspect element tool. Store it in an environment variable on your machine named `ADVENT_SESSION_COOKIE`. A fresh session cookie is good for about a month, after which you'll need to repeat these steps.

A full list of configuration options can be found [here](#configuration).

## Usage

advent-cli can be invoked using the `advent` command, or `python -m advent_cli`.

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be set to change the default config:

| Variable                   | Function                                                                                 |
